# rotate
This code was developed as an assignment regarding Image Processing. The purpose was to developed a custom image rotation algorithm capable of taking in any image and any number of degrees and then outputting the same image, rotated by the specified number of degrees. The code had to also rotate the input image around an arbitrary angle. In addition to this, I  implemented the ability to rotate the image in both clockwise and counter-clockwise directions. The code was developed for Python 3.6.9 and requires a compatible install of OpenCV to work.
