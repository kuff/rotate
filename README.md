# rotate
This code was developed as an assignment regarding Image Processing. The purpose was to developed a custom image rotation algorithm capable of taking in any image and any number of degrees and then outputting the same image, rotated by the specified number of degrees. The code was developed for Python 3.7.3 amd requires a compatible install of OpenCV to work.
